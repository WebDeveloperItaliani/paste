## How to Install

We strongly suggest you do use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in order to try this project with 0 effort whatsoever, if you have docker installed you can build up the necessary containers by typing `docker-compose up -d`, once done you can access into the main container by typing `docker exec -it wdi_paste bash`. Next step is configure it.

## Configure Development Environment

Once the containers are up and you have access to `wdi_paste` container it will be like a normal laravel installation with extra steps:

- Copy `.env.example` file in `.env` file
- Type `composer install -o`
- Type `php artisan key:generate`
- Type `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
- If you wish to try in the browser install all the necessary npm dependencies with `npm install` and compile them with `npm run dev`

Done.
